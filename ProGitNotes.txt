FILE GLOBBING
-------------
In computer programming, in particular in a Unix-like environment, the term globbing is sometimes used to refer to pattern matching based on wildcard characters.The noun "glob" is used to refer to a particular pattern, e.g. "use the glob *.log to match all those log files". Its notation is simpler than regular expressions, and without their expressive power. File globs patterns can be used in conjunction with GIT.




CHECKOUT
--------
Checkout is used to switch between branches.


HEAD
----
Head in GIT means the special pointer to the branch that is currently checked out.
