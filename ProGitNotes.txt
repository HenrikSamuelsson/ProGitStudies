DEFINITIONS
-----------
bare repository - a Git repository that has no working directory, it is just filled with the Git data.


FILE GLOBBING
-------------
In computer programming, in particular in a Unix-like environment, the term globbing is sometimes used to refer to pattern matching based on wildcard characters.The noun "glob" is used to refer to a particular pattern, e.g. "use the glob *.log to match all those log files". Its notation is simpler than regular expressions, and without their expressive power. File globs patterns can be used in conjunction with GIT.


CHECKOUT
--------
Checkout is used to switch between branches.


HEAD
----
Head in GIT means the special pointer to the branch that is currently checked out.


MERGE VS REBASE
---------------
Merge and rebase will end up with the same code in the end.

Use rebase on your own private repositories before pushing to get clean history.

Never rebase other peoples code, it will destroy their history, use merge instead in this case.
